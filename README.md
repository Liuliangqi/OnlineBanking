# OnlineBanking
This is a personal project that used advanced technologies such as Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Hibernate, 
Thymeleaf, etc. In this project I was aiming to develop an Online Banking System, and clients can sign up, log in and have 
Primary Account and Savings Account by default, they can deposit and withdraw money, also they can make an appointment 
for the purpose of asking for bankersâ€™ help. Clients also can transfer money between different accounts and transfer 
money to someone else. They can also check the histories.
